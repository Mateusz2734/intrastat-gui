# Intrastat GUI

## Introduction
Intrastat GUI (working name) is a desktop application that I built for my mother to automate some of her repetitive tasks at work. It is a simple, user-friendly tool that allows her to manage and process data more efficiently.

## Time saved
The table below illustrates the time saved by automating processes. It's important to note that this represents the total process time. Time reduction is determined by comparing the duration required to complete the process manually against the time taken when using the application. For annual time saved calculations, I have assumed 250 working days and 45 working weeks per year.
| Process Name | Frequency | Manual duration | Current duration | Time reduction (%) | Annual time saved |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| INTRASTAT | 1/month | 8h | 1h | 87.5 | 84h |
| INVOICE | 2/day | 40min | 5min | 87.5 | 291h |
| SAMPA | 1/week | 3h | 15min | 91.6 | 123h |
| DESHA | 1/week | 2h | 5min | 95.8 | 78h |
| SEM | 2/month | 1h | 5min | 91.6 | 44h |
| **Total** | - | - | - | - | **620h / ~26days**|
